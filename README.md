# Time_space_complexity
Worked on Code Complexity, which is a tool for measuring the complexity of a program arising due to Size, Type and the Nesting Level of Control
Structures, Inheritance and Recursion.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.

Space Complexity: 
Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.

The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Consider an example: Suppose a problem to find the frequency of array elements.
It is the amount of memory needed for the completion of an algorithm. 

To estimate the memory requirement we need to focus on two parts: 

(1) A fixed part: It is independent of the input size. It includes memory for instructions (code), constants, variables, etc.

(2) A variable part: It is dependent on the input size. It includes memory for recursion stack, referenced variables, etc.
